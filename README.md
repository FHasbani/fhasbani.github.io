Coursera Machine learning Project

## Executive Summary

The objective of this project is to build a Machine Learning Model that predicts the 'classe' of excercises that an individual followed, based on their captured activity quality from their individual monitors. The "classe" variable is one provided in the training set to help train the Model. We use any of the other variables to predict with. This report describes how we built this Model, how we used cross validation, what we think the expected out of sample error is, and why the basis on which we made the choices to build it. As a proof of suucessful prediction, we will also use the same prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.
